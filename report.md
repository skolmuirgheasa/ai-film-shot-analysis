    # Analysis Report: The State of Cinematic Shot Lengths (2020-2025)
    
    ## Executive Summary
    AI Video Models (Veo, Sora, Gen-3) are optimizing for long-duration coherence (60s+).
    However, an analysis of 1,972,248 shots reveals this is a misalignment with professional filmmaking needs.
    
    ## Key Findings
    1. **The 2.5s Reality**: The median shot length in modern Action/Thriller movies is **2.76 seconds**.
    2. **The 5s Threshold**: **65.3%** of all shots in the dataset are shorter than 5 seconds.
    3. **The Gap**: Only 13.0% of shots exceed 10 seconds.
    
    ## Conclusion
    Filmmakers do not need "One Long Shot." They need "Many Consistent Short Shots."
    The roadmap should pivot from **Duration Extension** to **Inter-Shot Consistency** (Character Identity across cuts).
