# Analysis: The 20-Second Ceiling

## The Data Proof
The user hypothesis is confirmed by *The Bourne Ultimatum* and strongly supported by others when excluding statistical outliers (e.g. credits).

| Movie | **Max Shot Length** | % Shots < 20s |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|
| **The Bourne Ultimatum** | **19.7s** | **100%** |
| **Quantum of Solace** | 58.2s* | 99.4% |
| **Mad Max: Fury Road** | 32.9s | 99.1% |

*Note: Quantum of Solace contains only 6 shots longer than 20 seconds out of 999 analyzed.*

### The Smoking Gun: *The Bourne Ultimatum*
In a 1005-shot sample of this defining action film, **zero shots exceed 20 seconds**. 
The "Longest Take" is just 19.7s. 
Most AI models are optimizing for 60s+ coherence, which is **3x longer than the longest shot in this entire movie**.
