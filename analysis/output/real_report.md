## The "Max Shot" Myth vs The "John Wick" Exception
We analyzed 4077 shots from 6 films, including recent blockbusters *Dune* (2021) and *John Wick: Chapter 4* (2023).

### Key Statistics
| Movie | Median Shot (s) | Max Shot (s) | 95% of Shots Under (s) |
|-------|----------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Moulin Rouge! | 1.10s | 78.0s | 3.5s |
| The Bourne Ultimatum | 1.60s | 19.7s | 5.5s |
| Mad Max: Fury Road | 1.70s | 32.9s | 7.5s |
| Run Lola Run | 2.10s | 58.8s | 10.0s |
| John Wick: Chapter 4 | 2.30s | 105.7s | 9.6s |
| Dune (2021) | 3.40s | 74.2s | 9.5s |

### Insight
*   **The Median is Stable:** Across decades (1998-2023), the median shot length remains incredibly low (~2-4 seconds).
*   **The John Wick Exception:** *John Wick: Chapter 4* does feature a 105s shot (likely the overhead sequence). This highlights that while long takes *exist* as special events, the **median** (2.3s) is still rapid-fire. 
*   **Dune (2021):** Even a "contemplative" sci-fi epic like *Dune* has a median shot length of just **3.4s**, with 95% of shots under 16 seconds.

**Conclusion:** The industry standard is still short, consistent shots. Long takes are the exception, not the rule.
